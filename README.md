# Pilot
Hey guys, I am Aattreya K.S, this is just an initial repository to tell you about what you could expect from structa.

- End-to-End LLM and SLM implementations (could be Colab or with interface)
- All about Computer Vision and using advanced models like Vision Transformers (ViT), implemented from scratch.
- A few Full-stack projects that do involve the use of Artificial Intelligence or Deep Learning in some form.
- Possibly even some tutorial style colab/jupyter notebooks.
- Me just having fun with whatever is latest and greatest in the sphere of AI
